            <p>
              I graduated with an associateâ€™s degree in Computing from the Technological Institute of Venezuela in 2020.
              After completing my studies, I began working at ITNoroeste as a Software Developer, where I spent 3 years honing
              my skills in software development, particularly with Angular, JHipster, and Spring Boot for web development and
              system integration. In 2022, I transitioned to Infocent as a Senior Programmer Analyst, where I took on more complex
              projects, provided technical leadership, and developed innovative software solutions, contributing to the company s
              success until 2023.
