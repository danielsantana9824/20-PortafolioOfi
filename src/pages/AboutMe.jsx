      <p>I graduated with an associateâ€™s degree in Computing from the Technological Institute of Venezuela in 2020. After completing my studies, I began working at ITNoroeste as a Software Developer, where I spent 3 years honing my skills in software development, particularly with Angular, JHipster, and Spring Boot for web development and system integration. In 2022, I transitioned to Infocent as a Senior Programmer Analyst, where I took on more complex projects, provided technical leadership, and developed innovative software solutions, contributing to the company's success until 2023.</p>
